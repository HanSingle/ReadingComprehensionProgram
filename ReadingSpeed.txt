       When orc raiders ransack a sleepy countryside settlement, the result is a tragedy; when fire giants do the same, the result is utter devastation. The distinction between an apocalypse and a raid by fire giants is semantics alone, as the conflagrations caused by these terrible warlords can consume villages, strongholds, and entire cities.
       Fire giants simultaneously embody the tempered reserve of finely crafted steel and the fury of wildfires. They are both the most warlike and the most organized of the giant races. They are contemplative, strategic, and violent. This is a dangerous combination for those that fall beneath the fierce gaze of fire giant nobility and their bloodthirsty generals. Fire giants' military campaigns are always preceded by careful, lengthy deliberation. Their war rooms and courts churn with activity; indeed, the undercurrent of violence can be felt in every facet of fire giant society.
       Fire giants revel in warfare on any scale. Massacres and genocides entertain these hungry brutes as much as do small-scale skirmishes or one-on-one wrestling bouts. Numerous societies mention fire giants in their fables and histories, though never in a flattering light. Always portrayed as ruthless soldiers and cunning warlords, and often placed at the heart of devastating legends and stories of catastrophe, fire giants exemplify the horrors of war. This isn't because they're gifted with supernatural strength or because the boulders they hurl at their enemy's smolder with heat and anger: those traits are accessories at best. The truth is far direr than can be illustrated in any apocryphal myth or children's story: fire giants are intimately associated with war and destruction in lore and legend simply because they are strong, and they despise the weak. Unfortunately for most of the world's other races, fire giants automatically perceive anything smaller than themselves as weak and pathetic.
